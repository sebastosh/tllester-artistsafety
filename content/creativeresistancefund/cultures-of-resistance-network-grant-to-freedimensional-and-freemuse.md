[![](/creativeresistancefund/images/cor-300x95.jpg "CoR Network Logo 11-17-11")](http://creativeresistancefund.org/2012/06/cultures-of-resistance-network-grant-to-freedimensional-and-freemuse/cor-network-logo-11-17-11/)Over the past year, [freeDimensional](http://www.freedimensional.org) has been further developing its Creative Resistance Fund as a conduit by which likeminded partners and funders can support individuals using creativity to fight injustice. Â A 2012 grant from theÂ [Cultures of Resistance Network](http://www.culturesofresistancenetwork.org/?page_id=823)Â enables freeDimensional's participation and technical support to the [Freemuse](http://www.freemuse.org) event, aÂ [World Conference on Artistic Freedom of Expression](http://artsfreedom.org/). In particular, this support will enable two exiled artists to attend the Conference in Oslo by covering their travel costs. Â [Freemuse](http://www.freemuse.org) advocates and defends freedom of expression for musicians and composers. Initiating the first ever [World Conference on Artistic Freedom of Expression](http://artsfreedom.org/) and launching a global network, [artsfex](http://artsfex.org/), for the protection of artistic freedom, [Freemuse](http://www.freemuse.org) aims to set a new agenda for artistsâ€™ rights worldwide.
