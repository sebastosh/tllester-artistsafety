Â As we embark upon the R&D phase of the Creative Resistance Fund, both [Res Artis](http://www.resartis.org/en/residencies/list_of_residencies/?id_content=4977) & [Wooloo](http://www.wooloo.org/open-call/entry/164175) are helping us _get the word out_ about a new rapid response distress fund for **artists doing the work of activists** ... and we thank them for this exposure!
