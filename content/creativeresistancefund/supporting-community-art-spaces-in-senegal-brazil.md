[![](/creativeresistancefund/images/IMGP1320-300x225.jpg "IMGP1320")](http://creativeresistancefund.org/2011/04/supporting-community-art-spaces-in-senegal-brazil/imgp1320/)I few weeks ago, the [Rory Peck Trust](http://www.rorypecktrust.org) asked freeDimensional to host a documentary filmmaker from a neighboring country. Â The filmmaker's work as a freelance journalist had placed him in harms way and together our organizations took steps to assure his safety. Â As freeDimensional transitions to become the Creative Resistance Fund, we are encouraging our art space partners to apply for funding to do the _critical hosting_ work we have designed and road-tested together. Â The Atelier Moustapha Dime (named after a famous Senegalese sculptor and managed by one of his former students) offered one of its bedrooms to the filmmaker. Â And, this is not the first time that a culture worker in distress has found refuge atÂ Atelier Moustapha Dime.

Â The human rights organization [Conectas](http://www.conectas.org) explained that this space, run by a group of local youth, hosts English lessons, capoeira classes and street painting workshops. Â When a local women's rights initiative and meeting place lost its funding, the youth invited them to have their meetings in the art space.

freeDimensional & the Creative Resistance Fund is proud to support both these critical hosting initiatives in Senegal and Brazil.
