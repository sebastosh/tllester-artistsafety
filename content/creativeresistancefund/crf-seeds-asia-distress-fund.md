[![](/creativeresistancefund/images/sangam_house.jpg "sangam_house")](http://creativeresistancefund.org/2011/01/crf-seeds-asia-distress-fund/sangam_house/)As the Creative Resistance Fund further develops, we will continually look for ways to distribute decision-making and resources to trusted partners in regions where we work. Â Often times emerging artist residencies are the most interested in providing [Creative Safe Haven](http://freedimensional.org/services/distress-services/creative-safe-haven/) to culture workers, writers, and dissidents in need of accommodation during a critical period. Â At the same time, emerging initiatives are usually fueled by the volunteerism (blood, sweat, tears) of their founders, and may need financial capital to match the social capital they present. Â A couple years ago, freeDimensional started the [Emerging Art Space Support Initiative (EASSI)](http://freedimensional.org/services/network-support/emerging-art-space-support-initiative-eassi/) to get to know the needs and possibilities of working with new and emerging spaces around the world. Â One such space, [Sangam House](http://www.sangamhouse.org/), a literary residency that happens in different locations around India told us of their plan to start a rolling fund for inviting writers from the region who are facing adverse conditions due to views expressed in their work. Â As a follow-up step to EASSI, the Creative Resistance Fund has made a financial contribution to Sangam House and their Rolling Fund. Â [![](/creativeresistancefund/images/logo_sangam.png "logo_sangam")](http://creativeresistancefund.org/2011/01/crf-seeds-asia-distress-fund/logo_sangam/)We look forward to learning from this process and gaining insight from Sangam's experience that will help us to make similar investments in partner organizations elsewhere in the world. Â We also plan to support Sangam House in the further development of their fund.
