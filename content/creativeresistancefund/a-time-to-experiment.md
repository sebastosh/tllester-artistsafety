[![](images/inge-300x177.jpg "inge")](http://creativeresistancefund.org/2010/12/a-time-to-experiment/inge/)The pilot phase of the Creative Resistance Fund runs from mid-2010 to mid-2011. Â During this period, the Fund will make 10-15 small, rapid-response grants to people using creativity to fight injustice. Â These grants may be used by the recipient to evacuate a dangerous situation; cover living expenses while weighing long-term options for safety; or act on a strategic opportunity to affect social change. Â During the pilot phase, the Fund will be relying on [freeDimensional](http://www.freedimensional.org)'s board of directors for all grant decisions. Â Over the past five years, freeDimensional has helped more than 70 culture workers-in-distress through its [Creative Safe Haven service](http://freedimensional.org/services/distress-services/creative-safe-haven/); based on this track record we outlined potential uses of the fund (listed above); however we are also open to tackling new challenges faced by artists doing the work of activists. Â During the pilot phase the committee has a mandate to _experiment_ with its grantmaking so that it can revise its funding parameters at the end of the pilot year. Â Here's an example of that experimentation: Â Back in July, an advisor to the Fund alerted the committee of the impending eviction of 96-year old sculptor, [Inge Hardison](http://www.freemaninstitute.com/inge.htm). Â With one look at Hardison's ouevre, using the Fund to lend a helping hand was unquestionable. Â Much of Hardisonâ€™s work is emotionally involved to her heritage as a woman of African decent. She has created a series of busts of African American heroes that she has called Negro Giants in History. Â Hardison is often seen wearing pieces of her work, such as a two-inch pin depicting Sojourner Truth. The original piece was a two-foot work given to Nelson Mandela by (then) New York governor Mario Cuomo in 1990. Â In addition to being a sculptor, Hardison is an accomplished photographer too. She was the only woman among the six artists who formed the Black Academy of Arts and Letters. Â Hardison once said, â€œDuring my long life I have enjoyed using different ways to distill the essences of my experiences so as to share for the good they might do in the lives of others.â€ Â The Creative Resistance Fund chipped in $500 (along with many individual supporters) to build up a bank account from which her future rent payments will come.
