[![](images/laura.jpeg "laura")](http://creativeresistancefund.org/2010/11/building-up-to-a-fund/laura/)Before we ever thought about developing a mobility or strategic opportunity fund at freeDimensional, we had several experiences that showed us the utility of quickly dispersing small amounts of money to artists, activists and journalists (all culture workers in our eyes). Â [Alicia](http://artsrightsjustice.net/profile/AliciaMarvan) [MarvÃ¡n](http://artsrightsjustice.net/profile/AliciaMarvan), founder of [GuapamacÃ¡taro](http://www.guapamacataro.org/), anÂ Interdisciplinary Residency in Art and Ecology in MichoacÃ¡n, Mexico, wanted to make sure that she could invite Mexican artists to join an international roster of guests. Â So, in 2007 Â freeDimensional gave Laura Silva Cervantes (pictured here),Â a dancer, teacher and choreographer from Oaxaca, a fellowship to participate in GuapamacÃ¡taro'sÂ thematic residency focused on [place and community](http://www.guapamacataro.org/2007/?lang=en). Â Also in 2007, freeDimensional responded to an urgent call from [The Rory Peck Trust](http://www.rorypecktrust.org/) for support to [Lamin Fatty, a journalist from The Gambia](http://), who quickly needed a place to stay for two weeks while long-term plans were being arranged. Â freeDimensional provided aÂ [Creative Safe Haven](http://freedimensional.org/services/distress-services/creative-safe-haven/) residency to Fatty at a partner center in Dakar, Senegal; and it was understood that - due to recent trauma - he would need to be cared for, fed and oriented by staff of the art space. Â In this situation, it was necessary to offer a small daily stipend to Fatty so he could pay for the essentials and build up his strength to make another move. Â And in 2008 we saw an opportunity to help [Darfuri Peace Singer, Abazar Hamid](http://freedimensional.org/about/case-studies/abazar-hamid/), begin performing again after he moved his family from Sudan to Cairo, Egypt. Â All three of these experiences were building blocks that helped freeDimensional (build a case for and) develop its Creative Resistance Fund.
