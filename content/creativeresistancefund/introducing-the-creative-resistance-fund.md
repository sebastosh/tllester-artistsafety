This site is the new online home of the Creative Resistance Fund, a project of [freeDimensional](http://freedimensional.org/). Welcome!

Since formally launching the Creative Resistance Fund, we met Kianoush Ramezani, Iranian cartoonist and chronicler of the Green Movement. [Reporters sans FrontiÃ¨res](http://www.rsf.org) notified freeDimensional that Ramezani was stuck in Paris without a place to sleep as he awaited political asylum status and he became the first official grantee of the Fund.

Thanks to Kianoush for the drawing above and see more of his work by [following his blog](http://kianoushlines.blogspot.com/)!
