Special thanks to Lemmitt Kaplinski for joining fD’s workshop and discussing his process and challenges in providing safe haven for [cheap oakley](http://www.oakleyonorder.com/ "cheap oakley") Georgian poet Zurab Rtveliashvili, adding the necessary personalized perspective.  ‘Shifting Gears’ included several performances, short presentations, workshops and discussions investigating the potentials for creative collaboration, artist mobility, resource exchange and capacity building between TEH member organizations.  Congratulations to the [Creative Center Carnation](http://www.nelk.ee/) for hosting an exciting and productive meeting. As Tartu’s first full engagement with the international arts community, Meeting 71 was an important moment in the history of that city’s growing art and culture scene.
