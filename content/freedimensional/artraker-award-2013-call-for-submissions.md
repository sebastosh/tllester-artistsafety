The Artraker Fund awards art that makes a direct positive change in countries that have experienced social upheaval and violent conflict. The Fund was created in 2012 by International Conflict and Security (INCAS) Consulting Ltd.

The prize of GBP2500 is awarded to the winning submission in London on International Peace Day (21 September) each year.

An international panel of judges from both the art and peace-building disciplines assesses submissions for the Artraker Award. They look for experimentation and engagement, audacity, change and capacity to inspire.

The Artraker Award Jury for 2013 includes: **Dr. Bernadette Buckley,** Convenor of the MA in Art & Politics at Goldsmiths, University (United Kingdom), **Adrian Harewood,** Canadian television and radio journalist, **Sidd Joag,** visual artist and Director of Free Dimensional, **Htein Lin,** Burmese artist and former political prisoner, and **Olufemi Terry**, an award-winning fiction writer and Associate of INCAS Consulting Ltd. from Sierra Leone.

The ten most inspiring submissions to this year’s Artraker Award will be invited to join the **Artrakers** **Network**. These projects and their initiators are promoted to peace-builders, curators and other art world professionals.

The Fund welcomes [submissions](http://artraker.org/#/apply/4571762921) from artists of all nationalities and at any stage of their careers. See [www.artraker.org](http://www.artraker.org/) for more information and our [application guidelines](http://artraker.org/#/guidelines/4571762267).

Founded in 2003, **INCAS Consulting Ltd.** works at the intersection of security, development and corporate investment. It is a maverick consultancy that has a reputation for creative and impactful solutions.
