**[![rabbit ABOG logo](images/rabbit-ABOG-logo-300x244.jpg)](http://freedimensional.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/rabbit-ABOG-logo.jpg)A Blade of Grass**, established in 2011 as the first grant-making organization solely dedicated to socially engaged art, today announced its second round of organizational grantees.  **The** **Center for Urban Pedagogy (CUP)** and **The Laundromat Project** were selected to receive project support in the amount of $20,000 each, and **freeDimensional** has been selected to receive $20,000 in general operating support.  A Blade of Grass will honor these grantees at a private reception in May.

A Blade of Grass’ stake in socially engaged art is organized around two key concepts: amplifying the role of artists as leaders and change agents, and assisting artists who operate in everyday life—particularly at ambitious scale.  Through an open application process, A Blade of Grass awarded three, one-time grants to “New York City based public charities that are finding new audiences and purposes for contemporary art by actively engaging communities.”  Organizations were able to request funding of up to $20,000 for projects that illuminate the organization’s mission and values, and demonstrate excellence in socially engaged art.  Applicants also had the option to request general operating support.  A distinguished Advisory Committee evaluated the proposals in terms of their artistic excellence; their ability to position artists in leadership roles; and their relevance to communities.

This year’s grantees demonstrate the political and social value of artists within local neighborhoods and globally!  We look very forward to working with CUP, Laundromat Project and freeDimensional in the coming year,” said A Blade of Grass Executive Director, **Deborah Fisher**.
