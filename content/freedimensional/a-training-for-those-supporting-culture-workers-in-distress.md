[![](images/sumertree-150x150.jpg "sumertree")](http://freedimensional.org/2011/06/a-training-for-those-supporting-culture-workers-in-distress/sumertree/)From July 15-20, freeDimensional is training 12 knowledge workers from around the world on our resource mapping methodology for supporting artists whose activist work puts them in danger.  If you know someone well-suited for this role, please share our [Case Consultant Terms of Reference](http://freedimensional.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/fD_CaseConsultant_ToR.pdf).  We will be hosted by the [Breuninger Stiftung](http://www.breuninger-stiftung.de) on their [Wasan Island](http://www.wasan-island.de) conference facility in the Muskoka Lakes of Ontario, Canada.  The event is made possible through the expertise and financial support of partners such as [Latin American Network of Art for Social Transformation](http://artforsocialtransformation.blogspot.com/2009/03/what-is-art-for-social-tranformation.html) and [Arts Network Asia](http://www.artsnetworkasia.org/main.html).
