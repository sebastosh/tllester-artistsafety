[![](/freedimensional/images/Issa-300x199.jpg "Issa Nyaphaga")](http://freedimensional.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Issa.jpg)Art for Health is a charity event that is hosted every spring to support innovative medical projects in Cameroon, Africa. Through art exhibitions, performance, live music, body painting, as well as slam and spoken word poetry, the artist's creative energy is channeled towards supporting health projects for indigenous communities in Sub-Saharan Africa as well as towards promoting the message of social justice and free expression for people world-wide.

Since 2009, Hope International for Tikar People, founded by Cameroonian native and activist Issa Nyaphaga and the Bush Medicine Partnership, founded by students from Drexel University College of Medicine in Philadelphia have been working together to improve the quality of life in the Tikar villages in Eastern Cameroon as well as other marginalized communities with no access to medical care. Thus far, the partnership has served the urgent health needs of over 8,000 people in the isolated tribal communities of Cameroon.

Art for Health, is a venue for transforming uninhibited artistic expression into tangible medical and public health aid for marginalized communities. Each year, the Bush Medicine Partnership sends medical volunteers and essential supplies to Cameroon to carry-out health campaigns in remote, under-served communities that lack even the most basic health care, villages which include N’ditam, where Issa was raised.  With cleaner drinking water, less chronic intestinal and malarial disease and crippling injuries, our hope is that these communities will become closer to being freed from the burdens of poverty, and be more able to focus on education, art, music and expression of their unique cultural lineage.

Art for Health will take place on March 31 at Project Reach NYC and is co-sponsored by freeDimensional. All are welcome to attend this lively event! The goal is to raise $10,000 which be used to purchase essential medical and surgical supplies for a five week medical campaign in Cameroon this Summer.
