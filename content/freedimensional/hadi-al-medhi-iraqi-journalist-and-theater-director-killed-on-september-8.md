On February 25, after participating in the 'Day of Rage' protests in Tahrir Square in Baghdad, Hadi along with three of his friends were beaten and kidnapped by nearly 15 soldiers. He told Amnesty International that he was taken to a detention center located in a former building of the defense [cheap oakley](http://www.oakleyonorder.com/ "cheap oakley") ministry, where he was beaten, electrocuted and threatened with rape.
