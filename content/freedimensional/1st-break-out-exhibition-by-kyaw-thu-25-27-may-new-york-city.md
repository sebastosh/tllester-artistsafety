"I have been denied all rights to artistic creation in Myanmar since September 2007, when I offered alms and water to monks walking in peaceful protest and reciting prayers of love during the Saffron Revolution, all the way to my current visit to the United States. I would like to call it the first breakout, the first artistic expressions from the heart, to be able to publicly exhibit the heartfelt works I have painted during my visit to America." - Kyaw Thu (film actor, director, producer, painter, undertaker)

First Breakout is curated by [**art@apt**](mailto:art@apt) (Chaw Ei Thein & KST) and is hosted at Project Reach NYC located at 39 Eldridge Street, 4FL. New York, NY 10002.

Opening Reception : May 25, 6-8PM / Closing Reception : May 27, 6-8PM
