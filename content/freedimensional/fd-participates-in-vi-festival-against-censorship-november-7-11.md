fD program coordinator Sidd Joag joins a roundtable discussion at the VI. Festival Against Censorship in Bilbao, Spain.  Now in its 6th year, the Festival is organized by the Basque production company Serrano in collaboration with FREEMUSE and in 2010 honored fD with its annual _No Censorship_ award.

Highlights of this year's Festival program include fD stakeholders:  Malaysian cartoonist ZUNAR, and Zimbabwean artist Owen Maseko.

"Zunar has been drawing editorial cartoons for the past 20 years in malaysia. Zunar uses his drawing pen as a weapon to fight state corruption and abuse of power. seven of his books are banned by the malaysian government."

"Zimbabwean visual artist and installation artist, described as “one of Zimbabwe’s most prominent artists”. His works referred to the massacres of Ndebele civilians during the Gukurahundi in the 1980s, carried out by forces loyal to Robert Mugabe. uses his exhibit to break the silence surrounding the conflict and give people a chance to tell the stories that are part of the ‘hidden history’ of Zimbabwe."
