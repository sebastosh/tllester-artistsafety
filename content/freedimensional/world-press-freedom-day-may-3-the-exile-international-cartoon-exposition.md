'Exile' is the brainchild of La Maison des journalistes resident, fD partner, and renowned Iranian cartoonist, Kianoush Ramezani.  The international expo, will take place on May 3rd 2011, and bring together a hundred cartoons by some of the most talented cartoonists in the world. A touring exhibition will start in the building of La Maison des journalistes in Paris and will then move to [Ray Ban outlet](http://www.raybani.com/ "Ray Ban outlet") several cities in France and Europe.  The main goal of the expo is to attract the media and public attention to the critical work performed by La Maison des journalistes, in helping exiled journalists who were forced to leave their home countries to escape persecution. La Maison des journalistes provides them with a housing solution and helps them through the many difficulties they face at the time of their arrival in France.  Posters, postcards and a catalog of all the 'Exile' cartoons will be created and sold to support La Maison Des Journalistes.

[Kianoush Ramezani](http://kianoushlines.blogspot.com/) received financial support from the [Creative Resistance Fund](http://creativeresistancefund.org/2010/10/introducing-the-creative-resistance-fund/).
