[![](/freedimensional/images/stockholm-300x199.jpg "stockholm")](http://freedimensional.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/stockholm.jpg)fD Director, Sidd Joag joins more than 100 delegates, guest writers and observers from as many as 32 different countries heading to Stockholm Wednesday 9-Friday 11 May, to take part in the 2012 International Cities Of Refuge Network General Assembly. Established as an independent, international organisation since 2010, more than 30 ICORN member cities from all over Europe and beyond will be represented when it all breaks loose at Kulturhuset in Stockholm.

In addition to the ordinary assembly procedures, the assembly participants will engage in vital issues to help determine the future of the young and growing ICORN network. Should ICORN member cities continue hosting writers only, or should our organisation consider offering shelter also to persecuted artists and human rights defenders? During a Market of Ideas fD has been invited  to discuss and share experiences around various topics including “The Art of hosting”, “Promotion”, “Working with PEN International” and “Preparing for the Afterlife”. fD will present and workshop its Creative Safe Haven and Community Resource Mapping models in dialogue with other participants.
