[![](/freedimensional/images/goree_inst3-225x300.jpg "goree_inst")](http://freedimensional.org/2011/01/taalifkat-tudunya-workshop-at-goree-institute/goree_inst-4/)[Taalifkat Tudunya](http://www.piroguecollective.org/workshops/), which translates from Woloff as “writers in the world,” is a ten-day writing and arts workshop for writers and artists hosted in collaboration between the [Pirogue Collective](http://www.piroguecollective.org) and the [Gorée Institute](http://www.goreeinstitute.org) on Gorée Island, Senegal. The next edition is January 5 – January 15, 2011. Four workshops in poetry, prose, visual arts and texts will be led by world renowned writers and visual artists and will be complemented by African academics and/or local creative practitioners. Participants stay in one of the Institute’s tranquil residences on [http://www.magliettedacalcioit.com](http://www.magliettedacalcioit.com "http://www.magliettedacalcioit.com") Gorée Island. In addition to joint public readings and exchanges with local associations of women, artists, writers and activists, the framework engages themes such as Translation, African languages, African thought systems, Mixed Media-the interaction between visual arts and literature, poetry and prose writing.  freeDimensional respects the holistic work of the Gorée Institute, thoughtfully merging issues of civil society with the potential of culture and creativity for social change.  We look forward to finding ways to support and collaborate the Institute, Pirogue Collective and future editions of Taalifkat Tudunya.  Also on Gorée Island is the [Atelier Moustafa Dimé](http://artsrightsjustice.net/group/mustafadimesenegal), a member of freeDimensional's [Emerging Art Space Support Initiative (EASSI)](http://freedimensional.org/services/network-support/emerging-art-space-support-initiative-eassi/), which recently hosted a Gambian journalist when he was forced to flee Banjul due to a backlash from his writing about that country's government.
