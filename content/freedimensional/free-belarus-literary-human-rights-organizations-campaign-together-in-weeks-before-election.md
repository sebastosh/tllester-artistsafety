[![](images/BFT_room-300x201.jpg "Belarus Free Theatre")](http://freedimensional.org/2010/11/free-belarus-literary-human-rights-organizations-campaign-together-in-weeks-before-election/belarus-free-theatre/)Founded in 2005 by a husband-wife team, the Belarus Free Theatre is the only unregistered - thus independent and therefore illegal - dramatic troupe in this post-communist country.  Effectively banned at home, BFT's performances have taken on an underground [Magliette Calcio A Poco Prezzo](http://www.veridianinc.com "Magliette Calcio A Poco Prezzo") existence, with audiences alerted via text message or e-mail.  Its covert and uncensored performances have drawn international acclaim. In the buffer-state between the rest of Europe and Russia, ruled by President Alexandr Lukashenko since 1994, the BFT provides a rare voice of dissent in what is being called Europe's last dictatorship.  This November in a show of solidarity, theaters around the US will host readings of co-founder Nikolai Khalesin's play, [_Thanksgiving Day_](http://www.mischiefandmayhembooks.com/thanksgiving-day/) organized by [Mischief + Mayhem Books](http://www.mischiefandmayhembooks.com/) in cahoots with freeDimensional, [Art & Democracy Bridge Conversations](http://www.statevoices.org/node/7832), and the [World Policy Institute](http://www.worldpolicy.org/blog/2010/11/15/freeing-belarus-through-theatre) in order to raise awareness on the situation in Belarus in the weeks before its next election.  Read DW Gibson's [‘Free Belarus’: An Introduction](http://www.mischiefandmayhembooks.com/free-belarus-an-introduction/ "Link to ‘Free Belarus’: An Introduction") in the Mischief + Mayhem's online magazine, Wild Rag.  See the [press release](http://freedimensional.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Free_Belarus_Press_Release.pdf) for 'Free Belarus' _Thanksgiving Day_ readings all over the US.
