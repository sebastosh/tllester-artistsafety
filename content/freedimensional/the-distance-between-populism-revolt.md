[![](images/blogger-300x198.jpg "blogger")](http://freedimensional.org/2011/01/the-distance-between-populism-revolt/blogger/)It is 2200 kilometers from Cairo to Budapest; 2090 kilometers from Cairo to Tunis; and only 1396 kilometers from Tunis to Budapest. Whereas the revolt in Tunis has inspired other North African uprisings, it is fair to ask why the the media played an [Ray Ban outlet](http://www.raybani.com/ "Ray Ban outlet") enabler for Tunisia while being collectively ambivalent on similar conditions in Egypt. A friend of freeDimensional and artist in Cairo wrote to say that 'yesterday was the most significant day of my life' referring to a street protest (pictured in at bottom right) he participated in on Tuesday, January 25.  Twitter is down [reports Laura Flanders](http://www.thenation.com/blog/158066/protests-cairo-forgotten-obama) and we're all wondering why Obama didn't add the word _Egypt_ when he spoke of the fight for democracy in Tunisia in his [State of the Union](http://www.whitehouse.gov/state-of-the-union-2011) address.  Is Tunisia - smaller, not as strategically-situated, and practically jutting across Europe's frontier - a safer expenditure of newsprint and airwaves?  Take Hungary for example - the current seat of the European Union presidency - where the "national public media is being concentrated, slimmed down and is now managed by government appointees."  The same [BBC article](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12140395) reports that "Prime Minister Viktor Orban has sought to defuse the crisis by accepting that EU legal experts will now go through the new legislation with a fine-toothed comb." Can the west's support of Tunisia _hold water_ if support is not also given to the protestors in Egypt.  When the EU shows signs of tolerating rightwing populism (e.g. Hungary) -- and with a new enough legal system that related populism across Europe can inform interpretation at the macro-level -- can we also expect that Europe's immigration concerns and their depiction in the [http://www.raybanoutletit.com/](http://www.raybanoutletit.com/ "http://www.raybanoutletit.com/") media will take primacy over aspirations for democracy just across the Mediterranean?
