The Creative Resistance Fund provides small distress grants to people in danger due to their use of creativity to fight injustice. The fund may be used to evacuate a dangerous situation; to cover living expenses while weighing long-term options for safety; or to act on a strategic opportunity to affect social change. The first round of grants was underwritten by [Freedom to Create](http://www.freedomtocreate.com). The Fund works with the Festival Against Censorship in Bilbao, Spain to make one travel and accommodation grant annually. The first monetary award was made in June 2010 to Kianoush Ramezani (see Kainoush's drawing, above), Iranian cartoonist and chronicler of the Green Movement. [Reporters sans Frontières](http://www.rsf.org) notified freeDimensional that Ramezani was stuck in Paris without a place to sleep as he awaited political asylum status.

The first Bilbao award was given in Spring 2010 to Umida Akhmedova, Uzbek photographer who was charged with criminal defamation of the state due to her documentary photography exhibit, [Women and Men, from Dusk until Dawn](http://freedimensional.org/?attachment_id=37' rel='attachment wp-att-37). Since 2010, fD has provided 25 emergency and strategic grants to individuals and collectives.
