Affiliated Projects may take the form of technical assistance to thematic campaigns, exhibitions, or events for which freeDimensional has past or present work experience. Affiliated Projects typically seek to raise public awareness on a critical issue and have the added benefit of external relations for the organization. freeDimensional is currently engaged in research on arts, social justice, public policy, and culture with the [World Policy Institute](http://www.worldpolicy.org); emerging art spaces and community engagement with [Musagetes Café / DodoLab](http://www.dodolab.ca); artist residency as safe haven with [FREEMUSE](http://www.freemuse.org); and artist residencies in conflict zones with [Residency Unlimited](http://www.residencyunlimited.org).
