During the 2010 Wasan Meeting, freeDimensional catalyzed the emergence of the [International Coalition for Arts Human Rights & Social Justice](http://artsrightsjustice.net), which facilitates broader networking amongst organizations that have their own programs and activities at the intersection of arts and social justice and are interested in situations of persecuted or refugee artists denied freedom of expression and the guarantee of free movement of artists and cultural workers overall. The Coalition is a network of aligned people who represent social movements, human rights organizations, mobility operators, host cities and communities of conscience, artist residencies and associations, and their related networks.
