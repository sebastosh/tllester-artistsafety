1. **Who is eligible for EASSI membership?** Community art spaces, cultural centers, or artists residency programs with an interest in engaging freeDimensional's mission by hosting activists in art spaces and strengthening community engagement. Members are typically in their first three years of existence or are in the process of shifting their organizational goals to address social justice or community issues.
    
2. **Does EASSI give grants to art spaces or arts projects?** Currently, the EASSI program does not include grants. EASSI does provide access to training, mentorship, and publicity for our art space partners. Through EASSI, freeDimensional seeks to connect emerging art spaces with funders, human rights partners, and other opportunities.
    
3. **What is expected of EASSI partners?** freeDimensional expects EASSI partner centers to be active participants in the fD network. Participation in the freeDimensional network varies between art spaces but can include attendance at network development meetings, participation in network-wide social justice campaigns, online participation in dialogues, hosting activists and culture workers in distress, and engaging other EASSI partners in collaborations.

5. **Do I have to host an activist or culture worker in distress to be a member of EASSI?** No. While freeDimensional is eager to grow the network of artist residencies that can provide a room for 3-6 months for an activists or culture workers in distress, Creative Safe Haven is just one of many ways an art space can engage social justice work and community engagement. For some examples of how art spaces work within the freeDimensional network, please see our listing of Case Studies.
