**In 2010, Reporters sans Frontières notified freeDimensional that Kianoush Ramezani, Iranian cartoonist and chronicler of the Green Movement, was stuck in Paris without a place to sleep as he awaited political asylum status.**

> ![](/freedimensional/images/IMG_3464.jpg "Kianoush peace")When I found myself in Paris, I was surrounded by a bubble. I couldn't communicate with the people. I couldn't understand even one word. In that situation, I needed to continue my way as a cartoonist. I should keep myself alive. And the thing most needed for me was "hope" and "motivation." Now I am an official member of one of the most important cartoon organizations in France and I can create my new cartoons. freeDimensional gave me strong wings with its grant so I could keep going. I will never forget these wings.

Each year, hundreds of culture workers are violently assaulted for pursuing social change through their art forms: as community leaders and role models, they lose their jobs; face arbitrary imprisonment; and are sometimes killed for speaking truth to power.

Based on lessons learned from our work with these individuals, we realized the need for an emergency fund to quickly respond to victims of work-related persecution or systemic marginalization.

So in 2010, we created the **Creative Resistance Fund**, which provides small distress grants to people in danger due to their use of creativity to fight injustice. Kianoush was the first official grantee of the new Fund.

With your support, we can take on more cases like Kianoush Ramezani's. You can have an immediate impact on the safety and freedom of those who are using art to change the world.
