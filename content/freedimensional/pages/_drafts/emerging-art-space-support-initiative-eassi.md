freeDimensional works with new art spaces around the world through its Emerging Art Space Support Initiative (EASSI), which seeks to increase the number of self-sustaining art spaces that can provide resources and residencies to vulnerable activists and culture workers. The 2009 Wasan Meeting was dedicated to strengthening a cohort of 15 such spaces located around the world:

- [Atelier Moustapha Dime, Senegal](http://freedimensional.ning.com/group/mustafadimesenegal)
- [Artkhana, Egypt](http://www.artkhana.org)
- [Caravansarai, Turkey](http://www.caravansarai.info)
- [Casa Puan (Proyecto Victoria Ocampo), Argentina](http://freedimensional.ning.com/group/casapuan)
- [Cura Bodrum Residency, Turkey](http://www.curabodrumresidency.net/)
- [Guapamacataro, Mexico](http://http://www.guapamacataro.org/)
- [JA.CA, Belo Horizonte, Brazil](http://jacaarte.org/)
- [Mamuta, Israel](http://mamuta.org/)
- [Maisha, Uganda](http://www.maishafilmlab.org/)
- [Sangam House, India](http://www.sangamhouse.org/)

- [Kamalenga House, Democratic Republic of Congo](http://freedimensional.ning.com/video/meet-pierre-mujomba-of-the)

EASSI provides technical tools and training, support and guidance, and access to funding opportunities that will help emerging art spaces navigate their first years of existence while preparing them to provide [Distress Services](http://freedimensional.org/services/distress-services/). First and foremost, the EASSI cohort is a community of practice with the potential to support one another through knowledge-sharing and collaboration as they become sites of innovation in their communities.
