freeDimensional is a decentralized organization that recognizes the power of strategic partnerships throughout its work. In order to stay abreast of global issues and instances of censorship, freeDimensional has established regional hubs in New York City, São Paulo, Berlin, Cairo and at two sites in India. Rather than a top-down imposition of values and programs, freeDimensional works with local civil society groups, social movements, arts organizations, schools and independent media outlets to build meaningful grassroots programs. freeDimensional is powered by the energy of its members, many of whom volunteer their time and resources to further its work.
