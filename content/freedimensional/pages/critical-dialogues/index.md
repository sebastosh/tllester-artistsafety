A Critical Dialogue is when we create linkages with advocates, policy-makers and the general public for an activist or culture worker passing through New York City. We host a three-day retreat in conjunction with our upstate New York partner,  [Writers Omi at](http://www.artomi.org) [Ledig House](http://www.artomi.org), and a public program with one of our New York City partners, e.g. [World Policy Institute](http://www.worldpolicy.org/), [Adelphi University’s Levermore Global Scholars Program](http://www.adelphi.edu/levermorescholars/), [Scholars at Risk](http://scholarsatrisk.nyu.edu/) or the [Flux Factory](http://www.fluxfactory.org/). [Resource Mapping](http://freedimensional.org/services/distress-services/community-resource-mapping/) is a component of the private stakeholder retreat.
