[![](/freedimensional/images/abazar-150x150.jpg "abazar")](http://freedimensional.org/about/case-studies/abazar/)We met Abazar Hamid, a peace singer from Darfur, when he was nominated to freeDimensional by FREEMUSE. His recent album was censored and related threats drove him to move his family to Cairo. Cairo is a city with hundreds of thousands of Sudanese living in exile, so it was only natural for Abazar to want to perform. There was one small hitch: he needed his work permit before he could perform, and he needed the proceeds from performance before he could afford his work permit. With a small grant of 200 USD, freeDimensional was able to empower Abazar to do the work that he loves in a new setting, and the local art space was helpful in arranging his first performances. Based on this experience, the idea for a [Creative Resistance Fund](http://freedimensional.org/services/distress-services/creative-resistance-fund/) started taking shape.
