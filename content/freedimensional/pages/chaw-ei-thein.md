[![](images/chaw-150x150.jpg "chaw")](http://freedimensional.org/about/case-studies/chaw/)After she left Burma and filed for political asylum in a new country, freeDimensional began sharing contacts and information with Chaw ei Thein. This dialogue resulted in paid speaking engagements, interaction with universities and media, support on residency applications, and a weekend strategy-building retreat at a partner art space. freeDimensional relies on a global network of art spaces, human rights organizations, social services and concerned individuals at the local level to help newcomers acclimate and continue their work in a new setting. freeDimensional performs a [Resource Mapping](http://freedimensional.org/services/distress-services/community-resource-mapping/) function as the first step for all applicants to its services. When Creative Safe Haven nor the Creative Resistance Fund offer the exact solution for an applicant, freeDimensional may tailor an orientation and resource identification period for a culture worker-in-distress in their new location.
