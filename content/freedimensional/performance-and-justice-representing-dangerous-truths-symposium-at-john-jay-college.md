_Performance and Justice: Representing Dangerous Truths_ is an interdisciplinary symposium on the interplay between broad definitions of performance and justice. The project brings together expertise in the performing arts, humanities, and social sciences.

At John Jay College, the term “justice”now includes definitions beyond the “criminal,” to encompass the academic, cultural, economic, environmental, international, legal, moral, poetic, political, racial, religious, social, and theoretical. For this project, we take “performance” to include film, dance, performance art, and theatre. The intersections between performance and justice are characterized by sites of social activism that lend themselves to sociological readings and analyses. Thus the symposium interrogates the ways justice is construed and constructed in various contemporary works of art and through the deployment of performance-based work in various traditional and non-traditional spaces.Â  The social justice impact of such art is not limited to academia, but extends itself to the court-room, home, prison, streets, and the democratic project at large. Through the lens of dramaturgy as is understood in both the social sciences and performing arts, the symposium explores theoretical and practice-based negotiations of justice as informed by artists’ prerogatives and the work of social activists.
