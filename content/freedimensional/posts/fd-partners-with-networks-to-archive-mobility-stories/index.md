How does artist travel relate to other forms of human mobility? At a time when tensions are high across borders and cultures (and hurdles to mobility increase), citizens, communities and governments are listening to artists and cultural programmers as vanguard voices on complex issues and look to the solutions they propose with renewed interest … even urgency!

[Vox Pop - Artists & Mobility: A matter of wealth](http://vimeo.com/15873230) from [freeDimensional](http://vimeo.com/freedimensional) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).

freeDimensional joins [Res Artis](www.resartis.org) and [The Upgrade!](www.theupgrade.net) to collect Mobility Stories from artists and cultural programmers.  We asked participants at the 2010 [Res Artis General Meeting](http://www.resartis2010.rcaaq.org/program.php) (Montreal) and _[Soft Borders](http://softborders.art.br/eng/)_ the 4thUpgrade! International Conference (Sao Paulo) to share their success stories, unsuccessful attempts, lessons learned and [Magliette Calcio A Poco Prezzo](http://www.veridianinc.com "Magliette Calcio A Poco Prezzo") tactics as they attempt to invite and host artists from across borders. Using the first round of interviews, we created a channel entitled _[Crossing Borders - The state of artist mobility](http://vimeo.com/channels/133307)_ that we encourage anyone who needs anecdotal experience for the purpose of lobbying to use freely!  You are also welcome to add more content; just [contact us](http://freedimensional.org/contact/) with any questions or input.  See the _Soft Borders_ [programme here](http://softborders.art.br/programa.html) and a new link at [On The Move](http://www.on-the-move.org/EN/index.lasso?page=http%3a%2f%2fwww.on-the-move.org%2fEN%2fnews_detail.lasso%3fshow_me_news%3d3286).
