[![](images/group-300x199.jpg "group")](http://freedimensional.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/group.jpg)From July 6 – 13, freeDimensional and Musagetes Foundation convened a Collaboration Laboratory (COL:LAB) on Wasan Island, Canada to solidify existing partnerships and explore possibilities for new models of cross-sectorial work engaging art, human rights and social justice. Through a series of dialogues, presentations and working sessions participants delved deep into conversations around international and cross-cultural exchange, strategies for strengthening regional networks, shifting funding paradigms, and the development of new mechanisms of support for artists at risk. Working groups developed actionable plans for moving forward on collaborative projects to be realized in the coming months and years.

COL:LAB participants included representatives from Residency Unlimited, Queens Museum of Art, Theatre Without Borders, Musagetes Foundation, Global Arts Corps, Arts Action Research, Zero Capital Arts, Project Reach NYC, Doen Foundation, Arquetopia Art Space,  Slought Foundation, Lambent Foundation, Center for Art and Thought, Open Society Foundation, J.W. McConnell Family Foundation, Drosos Foundation, The New School’s Thematic Interdisciplinary Program, Breuninger Foundation, as well as independent cultural practioners working widely in Latin America, Southeast Asia, Europe and North America.

We would like to thank all participants for contributing their invaluable experience and expertise to a robust, inspiring, and productive program. We look forward to growing these partnerships in the future and fortifying the global movement to defend free artistic and cultural expression as a basic human right. Special thanks to the Breuninger Foundation for their continued support and generous hosting of fD’s annual Wasan Island meeting.
