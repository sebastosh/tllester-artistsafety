[![](images/BFT_WPI-300x199.jpg "BFT_WPI")](http://freedimensional.org/2010/11/freeing-belarus-through-theatre-world-policy-blog-4/bft_wpi/)The Iron Curtain may have come down, but what remains is still in Belarus. Under [Alexander Lukashenko’s stringent regime](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3882843.stm), the capacity for individual expression is strictly limited. Creative endeavors like plays—regardless of its politics—are censored by the government. The [Belarus Free Theatre](http://www.dramaturg.org/?lang=en), founded in 2005, stages modern performances addressing social issues. While the company sells out internationally, they are still forced underground at home—where plays are government-sanctioned—staging covert performances in private residences. Many involved in the Belarus Free [Gafas Ray Ban outlet](http://www.gafasraybanoutletes.com/ "Gafas Ray Ban outlet") Theatre, including co-founders Natalia Koliada, a human rights activist, and Nikolai Khalezin, a playwright, have suffered for their involvement. They have had [several stints in prison](http://www.ifacca.org/international_news/2008/10/18/report-thessaloniki-2008-europe-theatre-prize/) and are under constant harassment by the authorities.

The group’s cause has drawn international admiration, and attention from organizations such as [freeDimensional](http://freedimensional.org/), a group which helps activist-artists, and [Mischief + Mayhem](http://www.mischiefandmayhembooks.com/), a newly established New York based publishing collective. Hoping to spotlight Belarus’ December 19th elections, Mischief +Mayhem is producing a Belarus-themed November issue of its online magazine, _Wild Rag,_which will feature a video project, short essays, and narrative nonfiction. In addition, the collective is partnering with local theatres across the United States to put out readings of “Thanksgiving Day,” a play written by Khalezin, about an [Ray Ban outlet](http://www.rives.es/es/rayban.php "Ray Ban outlet") elderly man living alone in middle-America, and his home nurse, a Belarussian immigrant.
