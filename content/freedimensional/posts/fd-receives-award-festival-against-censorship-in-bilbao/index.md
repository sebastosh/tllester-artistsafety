[![](images/bilbao-statue-300x238.jpg "No Censorship award statue")](http://freedimensional.org/2010/10/fd-receives-award-festival-against-censorship-in-bilbao/bilbao-statue/)fD received the annual _No Censorship_ award at the 5th Festival Against Censorship in Bilbao, Spain.  fD and the [Creative Resistance Fund](http://www.creativeresistancefund.org) work with the Festival Against Censorship to make travel grants and provide local accommodation each year for artists in danger due to their use of creativity to fight injustice. Last year this emergency support was provided to [Fahed Halabi](http://artsrightsjustice.net/profile/FahedHalabi), an artist decrying the oppression of women within his own Druze community.  This year the support has already helped Umida Akhmedova, Uzbek photographer who was charged with [http://www.oakleyonorder.com/](http://www.oakleyonorder.com/ "http://www.oakleyonorder.com/") criminal defamation of the state due to her documentary photography exhibit, [Women and Men, from Dusk until Dawn.](http://creativeresistancefund.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Umida_Akhmedova_Works-men-and-women-..-dusk-til-dawn.pdf) Umida and Todd Lester, fD director, gave a panel discussion at this year's [Festival Against Censorship](http://freedimensional.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/programa-Zentsura-At-3.pdf).
