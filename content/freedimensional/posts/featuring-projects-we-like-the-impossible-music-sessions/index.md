freeDimensional is now five years old.  Whereas we have a particular way that we actualize art and social justice by [hosting activists and culture workers-in-distress in the surplus (vacant) apartments of artist residencies](http://freedimensional.org/services/distress-services/creative-safe-haven/), we often see amazing projects that inspire us, innovate and show new approaches to advocating freedom of thought and expression.  The [Impossible Music Sessions](http://www.impossiblemusic.org) is just such an initiative!  Here's a clip about [Session #3, a tribute to Lapiro de Mbanga](http://www.impossiblemusic.org/session-3.html), which happened on 16 November 2010 in Brooklyn, New York.  Lapiro is [Ray Ban outlet](http://www.raybanoutletes.com/ "Ray Ban outlet") currently in prison in Cameroon on trumped up charges because he [challenged the president in one of his songs](http://www.freemuse.org/sw26753.asp); if you are interested in helping Lapiro keep his spirits up, [look here](http://artsrightsjustice.net/forum/topics/send-a-letter-to-imprisoned).  As you can see we have a new section where we feature _projects we like_ such as The Impossible Music Sessions.  We'll feature a new one each quarter.
