[![](images/jenin5-300x224.jpg "jenin5")](http://freedimensional.org/2011/07/israeli-special-forces-raid-on-jenin-freedom-theater/jenin5/)Special Forces of the Israeli Army attacked the Freedom Theater in Jenin Refugee Camp at approximately 3:30 Wednesday morning. Ahmad Nasser Matahen, a night guard and technician student at the theater woke up by heavy blocks of stone being hurled at the entrance of the theater. As he opened the door he found masked and heavily armed Israeli Special Forces around the theater. Matahen said that the army threw heavy blocks of stone at the theater.

“They told me to open the door to the theater. They told me to raise my hands and forced me to take my pants down. I thought my time had come, that they would kill me. My brother that was with me was handcuffed,“ he said. The location manager of The Freedom Theater, Adnan Naghnaghiye was arrested and taken away to an unknown location together with Bilal Saadi, a member of the board of The Freedom Theatre. When the general manager of the [Oakley Sunglasses cheap](http://www.troakley.com/ "Oakley Sunglasses cheap") theater Jacob Gough from the United Kingdom and the co-founder of the theater Jonatan Stanczak from Sweden arrived to the scene they were forced to squat next to a family with four small children surrounded by about 50 heavily armed Israeli soldiers. “Whenever we tried to tell them that they are attacking a cultural venue and arresting members of the theater we were told to shut up and they threatened to kick us, I tried to contact the civil administration of the army to clarify the matter but the person in charge hung up on me,“ said Stanczak in a statement from the organization.
