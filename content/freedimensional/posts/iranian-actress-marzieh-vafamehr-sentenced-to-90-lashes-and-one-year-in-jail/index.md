Vafamehr was arrested the first week of July 2011 in Tehran and was held in detention until 25 July 2011 when she was released on bail.

Produced in collaboration with Australia, Granaz Moussavi’s film “My Tehran for Sale” tells the story of a young actress living in Tehran whose theatre work is banned by the authorities. She is then forced to lead a secret life in order to express herself artistically.

Vafamehr appears in the film without a hijab. The film has been harshly criticized in conservative circles.

The Fars news agency has previously said the movie had not been approved [http://www.raybani.com/](http://www.raybani.com/ "http://www.raybani.com/") for screening in Iran and was being distributed in the country illegally.
