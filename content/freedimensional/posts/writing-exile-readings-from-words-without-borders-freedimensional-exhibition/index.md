**Words without Borders**, in collaboration with **freeDimensional** and V**erso Books**, present a reading from WWB's [September issue](http://cts.vresp.com/c/?WordsWithoutBorders/ab1da7bb79/cf64cbf2c9/67af628d1c), dedicated to writing exile. The reading aims to draw attention to the voices of writers forced from their homes, and will feature contributors and other special guests reading selections from the issue. To accompany the reading, freeDimensional will present an exhibition of work from contemporary visual artists who use creativity to fight injustice, and have experienced persecution and forced displacement as a result of their artistic practice.

The event will also feature the work of visual artists  **Arahmaiani, Zunar, Owen Maseko, Chaw Ei Thein, Issa Nyaphaga and others. (**Please note that artwork by Kardash Onnig will not be featured.)
