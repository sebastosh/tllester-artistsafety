[![](images/explore-juliano-zakaria-charlie-7212-300x225.jpg "explore-juliano-zakaria-charlie-721")](http://freedimensional.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/explore-juliano-zakaria-charlie-7212.jpg)Zakaria Zbeidi, the former commander of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades in Jenin who was pardoned by Israel two years ago, has been added to Israel's wanted list again.

In recent days, Palestinian security services informed Zbeidi that upon Israel's request, he must remain in the Palestinian Authority's detention facilities during all hours of the day and night, otherwise Israel will arrest him.

Zbeidi confirmed the report to Haaretz, yet [cheap oakley](http://www.gooakley.com/ "cheap oakley") said he did not know why the pardon was rescinded. Last week, Palestinian security forces arrested one of Zbeidi's brothers, along with one of the workers at Jenin's Freedom Theater, which Zbeidi directs.

In the summer of 2007, Zbeidi was among 200 wanted Fatah militants in the West Bank who turned in their weapons, under an arrangement in which Israel granted them effective amnesty as a gesture to PA Chairman Mahmoud Abbas.

In 2009, actor Juliano Mer Khamis founded the Freedom Theater and appointed Zbeidi as its director. Zbeidi also began working as an official in the Palestinian Authority's prisoners [http://www.oakleyonorder.com/](http://www.oakleyonorder.com/ "http://www.oakleyonorder.com/") division. The theater's founder, Mer-Khamis, was shot and killed last April. The case has not yet been solved.
