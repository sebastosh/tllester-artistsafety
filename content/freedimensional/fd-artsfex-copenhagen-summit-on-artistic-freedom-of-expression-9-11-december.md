[![](images/bft1-300x170.jpg "bft")](http://freedimensional.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/bft1.jpg)fD joins the Artsfex summit in Copenhagen on 9-11 December 2011 along with several prominent national and international artists’ networks, and freedom of expression organisations. The summit is organised by Freemuse and Danish PEN, and funded by the Danish Ministry of Culture. Participants will present [http://www.raybani.com/](http://www.raybani.com/ "http://www.raybani.com/") recent examples of censorship of the arts, and discuss the effects of censorship and repression of artists. Featured presenters include founding members of the Belarus Free Theatre, currently living in exile.

When the international community places emphasis on the protection of freedom of speech, it generally focuses on the freedom of media and literature. International human rights organisations include repression of media and media professionals in their annual and country reports on freedom of expression. However they rarely document repression of artists or cultural workers.

Artistic expression is under pressure from many sides and it is frequently in the centre of conflicts between different interest groups.

By bringing together a wide range of stakeholders who [Ray Ban outlet](http://www.raybanoutletit.com/ "Ray Ban outlet") have an interest in protecting art and artists’ rights, the Copenhagen summit will explore options for establishing **a global network** for the protection and advocacy of **artistic freedom of expression**.
