Direct service through comprehensive case management is at the heart of ArtistSafety.net and the means by which we activate our expansive network of artists, activists, and art spaces, as well as our Freedom of Expression (FoE), social justice and human rights partners in the service of individuals and communities at risk. Case management is the foundation of our research and documentation activities.
