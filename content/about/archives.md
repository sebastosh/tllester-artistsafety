**IETM Satellite Beirut / International Campaign for Freedom of Expression (October 2016)**

During the [IETM Satellite Beirut](https://www.ietm.org/en/Beirut) and related [International Campaign for Freedom of Expression](https://www.ietm.org/en/satellite-beirut-2016/international-campaign-for-freedom-of-expression), ArtistSafety.net and ArtsEverywhere launched a new initiative called _S.H.OP. talk_ (Safe Haven Operating Procedures). The process is both a learning cohort for new safe haven host sites for artists  and activists around the world, and will result in an online, Do-it-Yourself curriculum to be shared through the [Artist Rights channel](http://artseverywhere.ca/projects/artist-safety/) on ArtsEverywhere starting in the second half of 2017.
